\title{Expose data to rule packs}
\usage{
expose(.tbl, ..., .rule_sep = inside_punct("\\\\._\\\\."),
  .remove_obeyers = TRUE, .guess = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.tbl}{Data frame of interest.}

\item{...}{Rule packs. They can be in pure form or inside a list
(at any depth).}

\item{.rule_sep}{Regular expression used as separator between column and
rule names in \link[=column-pack]{col packs} and \link[=cell-pack]{cell packs}.}

\item{.remove_obeyers}{Whether to remove elements which obey rules from
report.}

\item{.guess}{Whether to guess type of unsupported rule pack type (see
Details).}
}
\value{
A \code{.tbl} with possibly added 'exposure' attribute containing the
resulting \link{exposure}. If \code{.tbl} already contains 'exposure' attribute then
the result is binded with it.
}
\description{
Function for applying rule packs to data.
}
\details{
\code{expose()} applies all supplied rule packs to data, creates an
\link{exposure} object based on results and stores it to attribute 'exposure'.
It is guaranteed that \code{.tbl} is not modified in any other way in order to
use \code{expose()} inside a \code{\link[magrittr]{pipe}}.

It is a good idea to name all rule packs: explicitly in \code{...} (if they are
supplied not inside list) or during creation with respective rule pack
function. In case of missing name it is imputed based on possibly existing
exposure attribute in \code{.tbl} and supplied rule packs. Imputation is similar
to one in \code{\link[=rules]{rules()}} but applied to every pack type separately.

Default value for \code{.rule_sep} is the regular expression \verb{characters ._. surrounded by non alphanumeric characters}. It is picked to be used
smoothly with \code{dplyr}'s \link[dplyr:scoped]{scoped verbs} and \code{\link[=rules]{rules()}} instead
of \link[dplyr:funs]{funs()}. In most cases it shouldn't be changed but if
needed it should align with \code{.prefix} in \code{\link[=rules]{rules()}}.

\section{Guessing}{

To work properly in some edge cases one should specify pack types with
\link[=rule-packs]{appropriate function}. However with \code{.guess} equals to \code{TRUE}
\code{expose} will guess the pack type based on its output after applying to
\code{.tbl}. It uses the following features:
\itemize{
\item Presence of non-logical columns: if present then the guess is \link[=group-pack]{group pack}. Grouping columns are guessed as all non-logical. This
works incorrectly if some grouping column is logical: it will be guessed as
result of applying the rule. \strong{Note} that on most occasions this edge case
will produce error about grouping columns define non-unique levels.
\item Combination of whether number of rows equals 1 (\code{n_rows_one}) and
presence of \code{.rule_sep} in all column names (\code{all_contain_sep}). Guesses
are:
\itemize{
\item \link[=data-pack]{Data pack} if \code{n_rows_one == TRUE} and \code{all_contain_sep   == FALSE}.
\item \link[=column-pack]{Column pack} if \code{n_rows_one == TRUE} and
\code{all_contain_sep == TRUE}.
\item \link[=row-pack]{Row pack} if \code{n_rows_one == FALSE} and \code{all_contain_sep ==   FALSE}. This works incorrectly if output has one row which is checked.
In this case it will be guessed as data pack.
\item \link[=cell-pack]{Cell pack} if \code{n_rows_one == FALSE} and \code{all_contain_sep   == TRUE}. This works incorrectly if output has one row in which cells
are checked. In this case it will be guessed as column pack.
